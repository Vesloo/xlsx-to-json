## Contribution welcome

In "src/ui/app.tsx", feel free to change the "fullPath" variable to use the directory you want line 12

```ts
const fullPath = "C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Roaming\\dbtest\\my-folder\\"
```

To use it:
```shell
npm i
npm run dist:win #for windows
npm run dist:mac #for mac
npm run dist:linux #for linux
```
This will create an executable

Run the executable

Added dynamic columns feature.
Choose the name and the type of your xlsx file.
