# This is a simple xlsx to json converter

## Contribution welcome

No need to configure file_path anymore, everything works in local

To use it start by installing the dependencies:
```shell
npm i
```
You are almost done, now compile it into an app (windows,mac,linux)
For windows
```shell
npm run dist:win
```
For mac
```shell
npm run dist:mac
```
For linux
```shell
npm run dist:linux
```
This will create an executable

Run the executable

Added dynamic columns feature.
Choose the name and the type of your xlsx file.
